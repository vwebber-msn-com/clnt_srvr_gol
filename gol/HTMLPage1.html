zSpace Coding Exercise #2:
Conway's Game of Life (GoL)
(Client/Server C Implementation)

Prerequisite: Complete Exercise #1 - Trivial GoL, which you will build upon for this exercise.

Implement: A client/server version of the Game of Life (GoL) via TCP/IP stream sockets.

The particular port number and protocol are up to you.

We provide a Windows sample implementation of gol-client.exe and gol-server.exe that demonstrate the desired functionality, and which is described below. Your implementation should strive to follow this behavior.

You should produce a single application binary that can be hard-/sym-linked to two names, gol-server and gol-client on 'nix or gol-server.exe and gol-client.exe on Windows.

Upon startup, the application should introspect its filename and behave accordingly as client or server, e.g. like busybox or toybox.

Starting the server should look like this:

start server

The server should listen on some port, and accept client connection to it. You only need to support the case of a single concurrent server.

On startup, the client should print out a summary of its commands, and then attempt to connect to the server. You only need to support the case of a single concurrent client.

start client

The client should be capable of sending all the commands summarized above to the server, most of which should be self-evident from the above screenshot.

The server should be capable of handling all these commands, and then replying back to the client with the resulting state of the board.

When the client receives such board state updates, it should display the board configuration and generation number as shown in the examples below.

Example of "." command (current state):

current state "."

Example of "R" command (random init):
random init "R"

Example of "S" command (single step):
single step "S"

Example of "3C" command (flip cell '3C'):
flip cell 3C

Example of "3D" and "3E" commands (flip cell '3D' and '3E'):
flip cells 3D and 3E

The "G" (go) command should cause the server begin computing successive generations automatically until explicitly stopped.

The "S" (stop) command should cause the server to halt the periodic computation state engaged via "G". This is the default state at server startup.

While the server is in the "G" state, it should periodically (every 3 seconds in our implementation) send the board state to the client.

While the server is in the "G" state, the client should display any incoming board state updates. (Note the gap between generation '>2' and '>2146' in the example below.)

While the server is in the "G" state, client and server should still be capable of accepting and dispatching all valid user commands.

Example of "G" command (go):

go "G"

The "Q" command (quit) should disconnect and terminate the client, but leave the server running.

The "K" command (kill) should terminate the server, and then terminate the client.

You can use this template for Exercise #2 (or roll your own from scratch):

gol-cs code structure server gol-cs code structure client

Once you are proud of your results, please send all your source files, make/project/solution files necessary to build it, and resulting binaries to system.software.jobs@zspace.com. We prefer a GitHub repo link, but a zip archive is also acceptable.
